                            <p>We decided on creating a 2D game, using our own personal thoughts and ideas on how to continue to promote an older style looking games, but with an more modern genre such as "The Binding of Isaac".</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Creation of our assets, such as the characters are made with Aseprite, an pixel art tool that allowed us to create many 2D creations that are needed for the game. Emma and Eryn has used this tool to create the characters and enemies that are available within the game.</p>

                            <p>For the aspect of the multiplayer game, we decided on creating a local coop game, for ease of implementation and a retro feeling with couch coop games.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The controls are split between each player with their keyboard, Player 1 uses WASD and Space bar for movement and attack, while Player 2 uses the cursor keys and shift for the latter. These controls will be shown down below the game to let the players know.</p>
                        </div>

                                    </figure>
                                    <p>As for the levels themselves, it will consist of linear progression that is laid out to the players. It will be closed in, interior type of level design such as caves, caverns, tombs, etc. to make a feeling of being trapped in from entering a forbidden place.</p>
                                    <p>To create these levels, we used the incorporation of Aseprite and Tiled. Tiled is an flexible level editor, that we can use tile sheets that are made from sprites, and we can stamp them in to place to create a level easily. </p>
                                    <p>Darren and Kyle created the levels by using the software and was able to produce various types of level layouts in the process, such as a simple tutorial level, to a varied open one focused on defeating enemies.</p>
                                    <p>Darren has created the main concept of the levels by being inspired by many games like "Hades", "Wizard of Legend" & "Enter the Gungeon".  </p>
                                    <p>Kyle also suggested that within the progress of the levels, it develops a visual progression, e.g. black and white to colour or 8 bit to 16 bit. This gives more character to the game and uniqueness.</p>

                            <p>Development of the game was made with using Webstorm 2021.2.2, our choice of IDE to type up JavaScript and implementing Phaser 3 (version 3.55.2 "Ichika")</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>We used many examples of code from previous projects and open source code, including tutorials from Youtube and Phaser Example Page, which helped the development of the game. It was a team effort to tackle many issues on the development of the code, and many of us are not experienced with JavaScript or Phaser than C# with the Unity Engine.</p>
